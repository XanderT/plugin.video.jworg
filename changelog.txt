0.5.0
-----

Changes:
+ Complete rewrite of video indexing
+ Video page shows directly the video list
+ The filter function is still available, but as link on very first video list page
+ Now every video json file info (in set of 10) will be parsed to autodetect if it's available the default resolution choose; if yes, a playable item is added to the list, if no a folder item is added to the list [these items are bold and blue, to easy identify a folder item and distinguish it from playable items]
+ Doubled the cache system for even faster item browsing: list of items is cached for 24h, but single item json file is cached for a whole month, because it's highly plausible it will not change anymore. 
+ Added a progress bar to help user to be patient when loading video index for first time (once per video page)
+ Enhanched fallback for video images detection; now you can play even the some old videos that was causing crashes before of today

Fix:
